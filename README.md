# SemesterProject
This was a mock up website using a local garden Nursery as a template for my Semester Project in Web Dev. Home page needs more images, an about or mission statement. Other tabs such as the basket tab does not have anything in it. Largely unfinished but overall a good starting point. Deployed on mongoDB atlas using .ejs, .html, .css, and .js.
